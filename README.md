# LUT-Visualizer

This tool enables visualization of .CUBE format LUT files. When viewed in text editors, .CUBE-formatted LUTs are unintuitive, and it's challenging to understand which lines represent which color values. This tool converts the RGB color values into the color they represent, and renders them in a three-dimensional environment in a way that it can be interactively viewed from different angles.

## Instructions

* Load index.html in a browser.
* Use the `1` and `2` keys to load example LUTs.
* Drag-and-drop .CUBE-format LUT files onto the canvas to visualize how they act upon color values.
* Use the `Toggle LUT` and `Toggle Side-by-Side` buttons to enable, disable, and split the LUT transformation of each cubelet.
